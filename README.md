# Linkedin Learning courses downloader
Linkedin Learning courses downloader Chrome plugin by SoberGrim

www.linkedin.com/learning has a lot of interesting learning courses, wich you would possibly prefer to download for further watching.
Sadly, there is no "download this video course" button.

This plugin solves the problem. Whenever you open a Linkedin Learning courses page with a video - this video auto downloads to your "Downloads" folder.
Example: you open "Learning Java" course, "What is Java?" video is auto started. The same time you are watching the video the plugin auto-downloads it with a name "Learning_Java_-_What_is_Java_.mp4" to
your "Downloads" folder. When the next video "Downloading Java on your computer" auto starts - the plugin auto-downloads it to your "Downloads" folder too. And so on.


# How to:
1* Install plugin to chrome<br>
Plugins -> Developer mode -> Install unpacked plugin -> Choose folder with this plugin (it will be shown as empty). Press OK.<br><br>
2* Open www.linkedin.com/learning -> open any course<br> 
You may open several courses in different tabs at the same time - it will work fine too<br><br>
3* Plugin starts auto-downloading any videos to your "Downloads" folder in background. Noting nore needed for it to work.<br><br>
4* ...<br><br>

5* PROFIT<br><br>

<b>Have Fun!<b>
