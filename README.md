# Linkedin learning courses downloader
Chrome plugin by SoberGrim

www.linkedin.com/learning has lots of interesting learning courses, which you would possibly want to download for further watching.
Sadly, there is no "download this video course" button.

This plugin solves the problem. Whenever you open a Linkedin Learning courses page with a video, it is auto-downloaded to your "Downloads" folder.<br><br>
Example: you open "Learning Java" course. "What is Java?" video is started. <br>While you are watching this video this plugin auto-downloads it to a file named "Learning_Java_-#1_1_What_is_Java_.mp4" in your "Downloads" folder (#1_1 is the video chapter number + video number). <br>
When the next video "Downloading Java on your computer" starts playing - the plugin auto-downloads it to your "Downloads" folder too. 
<br>And so on.

# Install:
Chrome -> Extensions -> "Developer Mode: on"
