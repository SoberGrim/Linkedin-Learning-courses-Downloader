# Linkedin learning courses downloader
Chrome plugin by SoberGrim

www.linkedin.com/learning has lots of interesting learning courses, which you would possibly want to download for further watching.
Sadly, there is no "download this video course" button.

This plugin solves the problem. Whenever you open a Linkedin Learning courses page with a video - this video auto downloads to your "Downloads" folder.
Example: you open "Learning Java" course, "What is Java?" video is auto started. The same time you are watching the video the plugin auto-downloads it with a name "Learning_Java_-_What_is_Java_.mp4" to
your "Downloads" folder. When the next video "Downloading Java on your computer" auto starts - the plugin auto-downloads it to your "Downloads" folder too. And so on.

# Install:
Chrome -> Extensions -> "Developer Mode: on"
